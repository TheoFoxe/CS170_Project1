When we were brainstorming and solidifying our ideas for this group project, we decided to make a diagram to represent our Node class (which is now `StateRep.h`) and our Problem class (which is `Problem.h`). 

In `StateRep.h`, we have all the information that is relevant to the state. This includes the current state representation, the total cost, and the heuristic cost. As shown in `StateRep.h`', we decided to represent our states through 3x3 2D arrays. The total cost and heuristic cost are both represented as doubles. 

After a while in coding, we found out it is necessary to use StateRep.h (just integrate all functionalities into the problem class is enough) and found out that operators are unneccssary to pass in, which makes the code more understandable for reviewers.

In the problem.cpp,

# Questions

1. Did you try optimizing your code by using special data structures that make searching for and comparing states faster?

 - Hash set: keeps track of visited states in a search algorthm, serves as an indicater.
 - Priority Queue: Manages the frontier where the next states to be explored, remain the order of puzzles absed on their heuristic plus path cost.

2. Did you implement a graph search (keeping record of all explored nodes), or did you use a tree search algorithm? If you tried both, you can compare the number of nodes created, and number of nodes expanded for each version (tree search and graph search). Note that you donâ€™t ned to implement and compare both tree and graph searches. But if you did, you can write about your observations.

We used a tree based search, and inlucded a hash string to record the visited state; however, tree search can be seen as one of the graph search methods.
